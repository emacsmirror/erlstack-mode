#+TITLE: Analyze Erlang stack traces

[[file:pictures/screencap.gif]]

Enable =erlstack-mode= globally to peek at the source code of functions appearing in Erlang stack traces:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(require 'erlstack-mode)
#+END_SRC

Moving point to a stack trace will reveal code in question. This plugin works the best with =projectile=.

* Customizations

The following variables can be customized:

** erlstack-file-search-hook

A hook that is used to lookup source code files

** erlstack-otp-src-path

Path to the OTP source code. Customize this variable to locate OTP modules.
